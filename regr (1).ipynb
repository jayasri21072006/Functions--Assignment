        "1.  **What is Simple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. It assumes a linear relationship, meaning the relationship can be represented by a straight line. One variable is considered the independent variable (predictor), and the other is the dependent variable (response).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    The key assumptions are:\n",
        "    *   **Linearity:** The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.\n",
        "    *   **Independence:** The observations are independent of each other.\n",
        "    *   **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of the errors (residuals) is constant across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
        "    *   **Normality:** The errors (residuals) are normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **What does the coefficient m represent in the equation Y=mX+c?**\n",
        "    In the equation Y=mX+c, 'm' represents the **slope** of the regression line. It indicates the change in the dependent variable (Y) for every one-unit increase in the independent variable (X).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **What does the intercept c represent in the equation Y=mX+c?**\n",
        "    In the equation Y=mX+c, 'c' represents the **y-intercept**. It is the predicted value of the dependent variable (Y) when the independent variable (X) is equal to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **How do we calculate the slope m in Simple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    The slope 'm' is calculated using the formula:\n",
        "    `m = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ[(xi - x̄)²]`\n",
        "    where:\n",
        "    *   `xi` and `yi` are the individual data points.\n",
        "    *   `x̄` and `ȳ` are the means of the independent and dependent variables, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **What is the purpose of the least squares method in Simple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    The purpose of the least squares method is to find the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the regression line. This line is considered the \"best fit\" line for the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **How is the coefficient of determination (R²) interpreted in Simple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    The coefficient of determination (R²) is a measure of how well the regression line fits the data. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. An R² of 0.75 means that 75% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  **What is Multiple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear Regression that models the relationship between a dependent variable and *two or more* independent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  **What is the main difference between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    The main difference is the number of independent variables. Simple Linear Regression uses one independent variable, while Multiple Linear Regression uses two or more independent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What are the key assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    The key assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression are similar to Simple Linear Regression, with additions for multiple predictors:\n",
        "    *   **Linearity:** The relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable is linear.\n",
        "    *   **Independence:** The observations are independent of each other.\n",
        "    *   **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of the errors (residuals) is constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
        "    *   **Normality:** The errors (residuals) are normally distributed.\n",
        "    *   **No Multicollinearity:** The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is heteroscedasticity, and how does it affect the results of a Multiple Linear Regression model?**\n",
        "    Heteroscedasticity is when the variance of the errors (residuals) is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. This violates the assumption of homoscedasticity. Heteroscedasticity does not bias the regression coefficients, but it does make the standard errors of the coefficients incorrect, which can lead to misleading hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **How can you improve a Multiple Linear Regression model with high multicollinearity?**\n",
        "    High multicollinearity occurs when independent variables are highly correlated with each other. This can make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each variable. Ways to address multicollinearity include:\n",
        "    *   Removing one of the highly correlated variables.\n",
        "    *   Combining the highly correlated variables into a single variable (e.g., through principal component analysis).\n",
        "    *   Using techniques like Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression, which are less sensitive to multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **What are some common techniques for transforming categorical variables for use in regression models?**\n",
        "    Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form for regression. Common techniques include:\n",
        "    *   **One-Hot Encoding:** Creates binary (0 or 1) dummy variables for each category. This is the most common method.\n",
        "    *   **Label Encoding:** Assigns a unique integer to each category. This should only be used if there is a meaningful order to the categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **What is the role of interaction terms in Multiple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    Interaction terms allow the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable to vary depending on the value of another independent variable. They capture how the effect of one predictor changes across different levels of another predictor.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **How can the interpretation of intercept differ between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    *   In **Simple Linear Regression**, the intercept is the predicted value of the dependent variable when the single independent variable is zero.\n",
        "    *   In **Multiple Linear Regression**, the intercept is the predicted value of the dependent variable when *all* independent variables are zero. This interpretation is only meaningful if it's possible and logical for all independent variables to be zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is the significance of the slope in regression analysis, and how does it affect predictions?**\n",
        "    The slope represents the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the independent variable (holding other variables constant in Multiple Regression). It is crucial for predictions because it quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship, allowing us to estimate the dependent variable's value for a given independent variable value.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **How does the intercept in a regression model provide context for the relationship between variables?**\n",
        "    The intercept provides a baseline value for the dependent variable when the independent variable(s) are at their zero point. While not always directly interpretable in a real-world sense (especially if zero is outside the range of plausible values), it helps to define the overall position of the regression line and provides context for the predicted values based on the slopes.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What are the limitations of using R² as a sole measure of model performance?**\n",
        "    R² can be misleading because:\n",
        "    *   It always increases as you add more independent variables, even if those variables are not relevant.\n",
        "    *   It doesn't tell you if the assumptions of the model are met.\n",
        "    *   It doesn't indicate whether the coefficients are statistically significant.\n",
        "    *   A high R² doesn't guarantee that the model will perform well on new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **How would you interpret a large standard error for a regression coefficient?**\n",
        "    A large standard error for a regression coefficient indicates that the estimate of the coefficient is less precise. This can happen due to high variability in the data or high multicollinearity. A large standard error makes it harder to conclude that the true coefficient is different from zero (i.e., the variable may not be statistically significant).\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **How can heteroscedasticity be identified in residual plots, and why is it important to address it?**\n",
        "    Heteroscedasticity can be identified in residual plots by looking for a fanning-out or fanning-in pattern of the residuals as the predicted values (or independent variable values) increase. It's important to address it because it violates the assumption of homoscedasticity, leading to incorrect standard errors and potentially misleading inferences about the statistical significance of the coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **What does it mean if a Multiple Linear Regression model has a high R² but low adjusted R²?**\n",
        "    This situation suggests that the model includes independent variables that do not significantly contribute to explaining the variance in the dependent variable. Adjusted R² penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary predictors, so a large difference between R² and adjusted R² indicates that the model might be overfitting the data or including irrelevant variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **Why is it important to scale variables in Multiple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "    Scaling variables (e.g., using standardization or normalization) is important when:\n",
        "    *   **Interpreting coefficients:** Scaling puts coefficients on a similar scale, making it easier to compare their relative importance.\n",
        "    *   **Regularization techniques:** Techniques like Ridge and Lasso Regression are sensitive to the scale of the variables.\n",
        "    *   **Gradient Descent optimization:** Some optimization algorithms used in regression are more efficient with scaled data.\n",
        "    *   **Distance-based methods:** While not directly a core part of OLS linear regression, other related techniques that use distance metrics benefit from scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **What is polynomial regression?**\n",
        "    Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is modeled as an *n*-th degree polynomial. It allows for modeling non-linear relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **How does polynomial regression differ from linear regression?**\n",
        "    While still considered a form of linear model *in terms of the coefficients*, polynomial regression differs from simple or multiple linear regression by including polynomial terms (e.g., X², X³, etc.) of the independent variable(s) in the model equation. This allows it to fit curves rather than just straight lines.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **When is polynomial regression used?**\n",
        "    Polynomial regression is used when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is clearly non-linear and can be approximated by a polynomial function. It's useful for capturing curvature in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "26. **What is the general equation for polynomial regression?**\n",
        "    The general equation for polynomial regression with one independent variable (X) and a polynomial of degree *n* is:\n",
        "    `Y = β₀ + β₁X + β₂X² + ... + βnXⁿ + ε`\n",
        "    where:\n",
        "    *   `Y` is the dependent variable.\n",
        "    *   `X` is the independent variable.\n",
        "    *   `β₀` is the intercept.\n",
        "    *   `β₁, β₂, ..., βn` are the coefficients for the polynomial terms.\n",
        "    *   `ε` is the error term.\n",
        "\n",
        "27. **Can polynomial regression be applied to multiple independent variables?**\n",
        "    Yes, polynomial regression can be extended to multiple independent variables. This involves including polynomial terms and potentially interaction terms for each independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "28. **What is overfitting in regression, and how can it be detected?**\n",
        "    Overfitting occurs when a regression model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, capturing noise and random fluctuations rather than the true underlying relationship. This results in the model performing poorly on new, unseen data. It can be detected by comparing the model's performance on the training data to its performance on a separate validation or test dataset. If the model performs significantly better on the training data, it is likely overfitted. Cross-validation is also a common technique to detect overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "29.  **What is underfitting in regression, and how can it be addressed?**\n",
        "    Underfitting occurs when a regression model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This results in the model performing poorly on both the training data and new data. It can be addressed by:\n",
        "    *   Using a more complex model (e.g., adding more independent variables, including interaction terms, or using polynomial regression if appropriate).\n",
        "    *   Adding more relevant features to the model.\n",
        "    *   Reducing regularization (if applicable).\n",
        "\n",
        "30.  **What is the significance of the p-value in regression analysis?**\n",
        "    The p-value for a regression coefficient indicates the probability of observing a coefficient as large as or larger than the one estimated, assuming that the true coefficient is zero (i.e., there is no relationship between the independent and dependent variables). A small p-value (typically less than a chosen significance level, like 0.05) suggests that the observed relationship is statistically significant and unlikely to be due to random chance, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis that the true coefficient is zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "31.  **How can you assess the overall significance of a Multiple Linear Regression model?**\n",
        "    The overall significance of a Multiple Linear Regression model is typically assessed using the **F-statistic** and its associated p-value. The F-statistic tests the null hypothesis that *all* the regression coefficients (except the intercept) are simultaneously equal to zero. A small p-value for the F-statistic indicates that at least one of the independent variables is significantly related to the dependent variable, suggesting that the overall model is statistically significant."
