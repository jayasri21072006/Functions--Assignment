        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   1. OOP centers on objects and classes: classes are blueprints, objects are instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. Classes define attributes (data) and methods (functions) that represent object behavior.\n",
        "   3. Multiple objects can be created from a single class, each with its own state.\n",
        "   4.OOP models real-world entities and their interactions, improving code organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.what is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class acts as a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        " - It defines the structure and behavior that objects of that class will possess.\n",
        " - Objects, or instances, are created from a class and inherit its attributes and methods.\n",
        " - Classes facilitate code reusability and organization by encapsulating data and functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.what is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Objects are instances of a class, representing specific entities.\n",
        "- They encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by their class.\n",
        "- Each object has its own unique state, even if created from the same class.\n",
        "- Objects interact with each other, forming the dynamic parts of an OOP program.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - Abstraction:\n",
        "  - Focuses on what an object does, rather than how it does it.\n",
        "  - It's about hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.\n",
        "  - It simplifies complex systems by providing a high-level view.\n",
        "    Often achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        " - Essentially, abstraction is about showing the \"what\" and hiding the \"how\".\n",
        "- Encapsulation:\n",
        " - Focuses on bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (a class).\n",
        "- It's about controlling access to the internal state of an object, protecting it from unintended modifications.\n",
        "It promotes data hiding through the use of access modifiers (e.g., private, public).\n",
        "Encapsulation is about the \"how\" data is protected\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " In Python, \"dunder\" methods, also known as \"magic\" or \"special\" methods, are methods with double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., __init__, __str__). These methods allow you to define how your objects interact with Python's built-in functions and operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        " Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (the child or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (the parent or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  Polymorphism in OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. It enables code to work with various objects without knowing their specific classes, promoting flexibility and reusability. It's achieved through method overriding (runtime) where subclasses provide their own implementations of parent class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Data Hiding:\n",
        "  Python uses naming conventions, particularly prefixing attributes with double underscores (__), to indicate that they are \"private.\" This signals that they should not be accessed directly from outside the class. they also invloves protected classes.\n",
        "- Controlled Access:\n",
        "  Encapsulation is further achieved by providing getter and setter methods (or using the @property decorator) to control how data is accessed and modified. This allows for validation and prevents unintended changes\n",

        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " In Python, a constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        " -  __init__ Method:\n",
        "The constructor in Python is always named __init__. This is a reserved method name.\n",
        "- It's defined within the class and is executed when a new instance of the class is created.\n",
        "- Initialization:\n",
        "The __init__ method is used to set the initial state of the object. This typically involves assigning values to the object's attributes.\n",
        "The self parameter is the first parameter of the __init__ method, and it refers to the instance of the object being created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " Class Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Definition:\n",
        "A class method is bound to the class and not the instance of the class.\n",
        "It takes the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls.\n",
        "It's defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        " Static Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Definition:\n",
        "A static method is also bound to the class, but it doesn't take the class or instance as an implicit first argument.\n",
        "It's defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "It essentially behaves like a regular function, but it's contained within the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class. Python does not support traditional method overloading like Java or C++. Instead, it uses default arguments and variable-length argument lists to achieve similar functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows a subclass to customize or extend the behavior of the inherited method. It's a key aspect of polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " The @property decorator in Python is used to define methods that can be accessed like attributes. It allows you to implement getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute. This provides controlled access to instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism in OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.

        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. It can contain abstract methods, which must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " OOP promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability. It simplifies complex systems by breaking them down into manageable objects. It enhances data security through encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " A class variable is shared among all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each instance. Class variables are defined within the class but outside any methods, whereas instance variables are defined within the __init__ method. Class variables are accessed via the class itself or any instance, instance variables via instance\n",

        "The super() function is used to call methods from a parent class within a subclass. It enables subclasses to extend or modify the behavior of parent class methods. It's essential for proper inheritance and method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " The __del__ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). It allows you to perform cleanup operations, like closing files or releasing resources. However, relying heavily on __del__ is generally discouraged due to its unpredictable execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " @staticmethod defines a method that doesn't receive any implicit first argument (neither self nor cls). @classmethod defines a method that receives the class itself as the first argument (cls). Static methods are like regular functions within a class, while class methods operate on the class itself.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with ?\n",
        " Polymorphism in Python with inheritance is achieved through method overriding. Subclasses can provide their own implementations of methods defined in their superclasses. When a method is called on an object, Python dynamically determines which implementation to use based on the object's type.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  Method chaining allows multiple method calls to be made sequentially on the same object. Each method returns the object itself, enabling subsequent method calls. This technique improves code readability and conciseness. It's often used with mutable objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. When an object has a __call__ method, you can invoke it by using parentheses after the object's name. This makes the object callable.\n",
